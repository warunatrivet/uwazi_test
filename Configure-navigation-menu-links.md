3. Click on Add link to add a new menu link. To add a link to a list of filter results, run that filter and copy the URL in your browser. Each filter you run in Uwazi has a unique URL so it is easy to share the results.

Note: Use only relative URLs (starting with a /) and not fully formed URLs like http://www.google.com. If you copied a page universal URL, be sure to delete the first part (http://yourdomain.com).
