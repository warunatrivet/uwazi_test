# Custom header

Sadly is not possible to edit your header from Settings right now, but we will work to make it available soon. Meanwhile, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/issue/) and we will customise the header background image for you.

Requirements:

- Your logotype in PNG format (transparent background) and 72px height. Width is not fixed, but limited to 288px, so you can play until that size.
- Your brand colour to change the header background.

We will upload all the changes it for you once you have the final design.
