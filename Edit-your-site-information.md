In your settings, you can edit your site information such as: the name of your site and the homepage.

1. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the site

# Name
This is easy: your collection name :)

# Landing page
The landing page is the first thing users will see when visiting your Uwazi instance. By default, your landing page is the Library, without any filter applied and a list with all documents and entities.

However you can use any page from your Uwazi instance as a landing page, just copying and pasting the URL on the text box below custom page.

These are some examples:

- A [static page](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Create-pages): `/page/dicxg0oagy3xgr7ixef80k9`
- A [library query](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Filter): `/library/?searchTerm=test`
- A document or entity: `/document/4y9i99fadjp833di` `/entity/9htbkgpkyy7j5rk9`

Always use URLs relative to your site, starting with / and skipping the `https://yoursite.com`.

# Custom header

Sadly is not possible to edit your header from Settings right now, but we will work to make it available soon. Meanwhile, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/issue/) and we will customise the header background image for you.

Requirements:

- Your logotype in PNG format (transparent background) and 72px height. Width is not fixed, but limited to 288px, so you can play until that size.
- Your brand colour to change the header background.

We will upload all the changes it for you once you have the final design.
