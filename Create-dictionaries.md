A dictionary in Uwazi is a list of terms that you will reference in the properties. For example, you may want to create a dictionary for countries so that you can refer to this list when you add the _country_ property to your document template.

You can view, edit and delete your existing dictionaries by going to _Dictionaries_.

## Follow these steps:

1. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the site.
