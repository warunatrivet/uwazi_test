## How to upload documents

At this time, Uwazi supports PDF format only. We recommend you use [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/) to convert any .doc, .txt, .odt, or other document file formats to PDF. 

PDFs allow us to work with the text of a document. Other file formats such as .doc, .txt, .odt, .jpg, etc can be included in your document collection as an attachment to your PDF document. This might come in handy when you the original file is something other than a PDF and you want to archive it with the PDF version. 

Upload your PDFs by clicking on the upload icon in the top right corner of the site.

![upload](http://www.uwazi.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/doc-upload.png)

You can either drag and drop your PDF files into the designated box, or you can browse your local files and select which ones you want to upload. 

![upload options](http://www.uwazi.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/upload2.png)

Your files will be added to the upload section of Uwazi, but they will not be published until you assign a template and click _publish_ (see below).

## How to publish your documents

Before you publish your documents, you need to assign a document template to them (and preferably some metadata as well). To do that you can select one document, make your edits in the right sidebar, and then click _save_:

You can also [select and edit multiple documents](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Applying-properties-to-your-documents#how-to-addedit-properties-on-multiple-documents-at-once). 

When you are finished adding properties to your unpublished documents, you can publish them by clicking on the button with the paper airplane icon:

## How to create entities 
An entity in Uwazi is content that is similar to a document in the way it is organised, but does not require a PDF. For example, you may want to create entities in order to include a people, events, courts, or cases in your collection.

Before you create a new entity, you will want to [create your entity template(s)](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Build-the-information-architecture). 

Create a new entity by clicking on the upload icon in the top right corner of the site.

![upload](http://www.uwazi.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/doc-upload.png)

Then click the _add entity_ button in the bottom right corner of the site.
