## How to upload documents

At this time, Uwazi only supports PDF format. We recommend you use [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/) to convert any .doc, .txt, .odt, or other document file formats to PDF. 

PDFs allow us to work with the text of a document. Other file formats such as .doc, .txt, .odt, .jpg, etc can be included in your document collection as an "attachment" to your PDF document. This might come in handy when you the original file is something other than a PDF and you want to archive it with the PDF version. 

Upload your PDFs by clicking on the upload icon in the top right corner of the site.
