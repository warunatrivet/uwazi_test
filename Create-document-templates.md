Templates allow you to collect structured, consistent metadata on your documents. Within each template, you can assign properties of the type:
* text 
* numeric
* select
* multi-select
* date
* rich text

For example, you may want to create a document template called "NGO Reports" which will contain properties such as title, date published, NGO author, etc. You will create one document template for each type of document that has a distinct set of property types.

Under _Documents_, you can view, edit, and delete existing document templates. 

1. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the site.

Note: When you add a **multi-select property** to a template, you will see a field titled _Thesauri_ in which you can select a _Dictionary_ or an entity that you have already created. See the section on [managing your dictionaries](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Build-the-information-architecture#manage-your-dictionaries) for more information on how to create these dictionaries.
