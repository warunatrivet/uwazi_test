Uwazi supports connecting data in unstructured ways, meaning you don't need to follow a particular data structure or predefine a relational model upfront. Both entities and documents can be connected to each other in one-to-one or one-to-many relations arbitrarily:

Uwazi relationships support information hubs, that is, a concentrator that holds together a series of documents or entities. Hubs are useful for telling apart mixed information. Ie. a person may be related to two different legal cases but you want that information segregated:
