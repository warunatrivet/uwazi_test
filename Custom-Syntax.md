Apart from [basic syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), you can use special syntax developed specifically for Uwazi that will add new features to your collection:

# Cards

If you have a Custom Page and you want to add some cards from the Library, you just need to search on the Library and copy the URL. Once you did it, you can go to your page and add this syntax:

    {list}(https://UwaziSearchURL)

# Youtube support

You can add Youtube videos to any Rich text field with this markup:

    {youtube}(https://YoutubeVideoURL)
