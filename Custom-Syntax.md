Apart from [basic syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), you can use special syntax developed specifically for Uwazi that will add new features to your collection:

# Cards

If you have a Custom Page and you want to add some cards from the Library, you just need to search on the Library and copy the URL. Once you did it, you can go to your page and add this syntax:

    {list}(https://UwaziSearchURL)

In this example you can see how CEJIL uses a search with _last updated documents_ and includes them in a custom page with an explanation of the organization.

# Youtube support

You can add Youtube videos to any Rich text field with this markup:

    {youtube}(https://YoutubeVideoURL)

This video can be rendered on cards, sidepanels and inside entities.
