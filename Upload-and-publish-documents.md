# Import documents into Uwazi

Uwazi currently only supports uploading PDF text. By only using PDF, Uwazi is able to carry out numerous functions on the document like conducting full text search, create a table of contents, text references and other functions.

Other text formats like .doc, .txt, .odt, .jpg can be included in your document collection as an attachment to your PDF document. This can help you archive the original document. 

You can convert any Uwazi entity into a PDF by uploading a “main file”.

Once the PDFs are ready, you have to upload them. To do this;
1. Click on the **upload**, besides ‘setting’
