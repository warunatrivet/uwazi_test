You have your Uwazi platform deployed, but not sure where to start? Here are some initial steps to take:

## Change your password and add email.
When you receive your Uwazi URL and log-in credentials, the first thing you will want to do is log-in, then go to “Settings > Account” to change your password, and add your email address.

## Decide on privacy.
If necessary, set your instance to “private” under “Settings > Collection”.

## Create users.
Create users under “Settings > Users”.

## Create entity types.
Now you’re ready to start configuring Uwazi to organise your information. 
The first step is to create entity templates under “Templates”. 
These templates serve as containers for your information and are based on your data model. 
For each template, you will add “properties”.

## Create thesauri.
For "multi select" properties, create thesauri for each list you want the user to choose from.
Create relationship types.
