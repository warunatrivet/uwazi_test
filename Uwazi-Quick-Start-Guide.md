You have your Uwazi platform deployed, but not sure where to start? Here are some initial steps to take:

## Change your password and add email.
When you receive your Uwazi URL and log-in credentials, the first thing you will want to do is log-in, then go to “Settings > Account” to change your password, and add your email address.

## Decide on privacy.
If necessary, set your instance to “private” under “Settings > Collection”.

## Create users.
Create users under “Settings > Users”.

## Create entity types.
Now you’re ready to start configuring Uwazi to organise your information. 
The first step is to create entity templates under “Templates”. 
These templates serve as containers for your information and are based on your data model. 
For each template, you will add “properties”. Each property represents a type of metadata that you want to capture and potentially analyse.

## Create thesauri.
For "multi select" properties, create thesauri for each list you want the user to choose from.

## Add entities to Uwazi.
Now that you have at least one entity type/template, you can begin to add your entities. An "entity" is simply any unique set of information in the database. When you create a new entity, you will add metadata to it by selecting the appropriate properties. 
You can also upload a PDF to Uwazi to create a new entity based on that document.
When you are ready to share your entity in the "Public documents" section, select "Publish" on the entity. (Note: if your Uwazi instance is set to "Private", the entities/documents are only shared with other users who have the permission to view this information.)
