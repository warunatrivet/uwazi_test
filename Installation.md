[Contact the Uwazi team](http://www.uwazi.io/contact-us/) if you would like us to host an Uwazi instance for you.

Otherwise, you can download the latest version of Uwazi here on [Github](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/releases). Be sure you have everything configured on your server first - here is a [list of Uwazi's dependencies](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/blob/development/README.md).
