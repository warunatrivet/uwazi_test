Filters are a great way to manage your collection of documents based on the properties assigned to each document or entity.

The first thing you need to do is select a document or property template from the right panel on the library. This will perform a search of every document belongs that type.

Once you selected one document or entity template, the side panel will update the filters and you will be able to use more filters options to dig in more in your search. Those options are **properties** assigned to each document or entity template on Settings. You can review [how to create document templates](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Create-document-templates) or [how to create entity templates](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Create-entity-templates) for further information about adding properties into a template.

Something interesting is when you use more than one template to filter your collection. Our system will match every property in each template to get the common properties used in all of them and let you filter by those properties without any problem. In the example you can see how we use different templates with a common property (Country), so we can perform a deeper search with about all the items in our collection that belongs to one or more specific countries:
