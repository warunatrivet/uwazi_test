Connections allow you to link up two documents or entities without any hierarchical structure. You just select one of them, click on connect and the link is made.

You can see all the connections a document has on the right panel, clicking on the **Connections** tab. Notice that you can create a connection **inside** the document, not from Library (we will improve this soon).

To create a new connection, just click on the **Edit** button and then on the Add entities / documents +:

In the next step you will be able to select the _connection type_ and the _target document/entity_. Use the search field to find your connection's _target document/entity_ by typing in words from the title of the document/entity.
You can read more about [Connections setup](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Name-connections) to create new kind of connections and use them on your collection.

Now your new connection will appear on the Connection tab.

Also you can view the connections on an entity clicking on the **Connections** tab in the right sidebar. The results will display in the main viewing window. Here is an example:
