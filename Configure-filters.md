2. Click on _Filters_

3. For each document or entity type that you want your user to be able to filter, drag and drop that item from the right column to the _Filterable types_ window. You can further organise these filters by creating _Groups_ of filters, meaning you can organise a group of filters together beneath  a label (such as the 'Documents' group in the screenshot above).
