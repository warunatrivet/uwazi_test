A collection of good ideas people mention in no particular order:

* **Relation map view**: Have a graph view displaying relations between documents and other spatially relevant parameters (date, judge, etc).
* **Snippet search results**: list of referenced/annotated/bookmarked text snippets instead of documents as search results.
* **Support OCR**: ddd OCR capabilities to uploads section.
* **Automatically extract table of contents**
* **Automatically extract document properties**
* **Lazy load of document pages in viewer**: documents may be too big for loading in certain devices. A potential solution for this problem could be implementing a lazy load strategy for document pages.
* **Automatically extract document properties**
* **Analytics and user session tracking**
* **Breadcrumb navigation**
* **Import dictionary options from CSV**
* **Easy way to spot documents that don't have properties existing in the template**: this may typically happen after an edition to the document template.
