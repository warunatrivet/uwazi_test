Document types allow you to attribute structured, consistent metadata to your documents. For each document template, you can assign properties of the type:
* text 
* numeric
* select
* multi-select
* date, date range, multi date, multi date range
* rich text
* geolocation

For example, you may want to create a document type called "NGO Reports" which will contain properties such as title, date published, NGO author, etc. You will create one document type for each kind of document that has a distinct set of properties.

Under _Documents_, you can view, edit, and delete existing document types. 

## Follow these steps:

1. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the site.

When adding a new property to a document or entity type, you can choose whether you want that property to: be required, show in the library cards, and/or be included in the list of filters for which your users have access.

Note: When you add a **multi-select property** to a type, you will see a field titled _Thesauri_ in which you can select a _Dictionary_ or an _Entity type_ that you have already created. See the section on [managing your dictionaries](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Build-the-information-architecture#manage-your-dictionaries) for more information on how to create these dictionaries.
