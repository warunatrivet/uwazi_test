In order to publish your documents, there needs to be a template and some metadata assigned to it.
1. Select the document you want to publish and click **Edit**
2. Make your edits in the Right Sidebar
3. Click **Save**

Once you have finished adding properties to your unpublished documents, you can choose to publish or unpublish a document by clicking on the **publish/unpublish** button
