Uwazi relationships support information hubs that hold together a series of documents or entities.  The documents or entities in these hubs will have relationships with each other and will also infer other relationships that might have been previously overlooked. 

Hubs are also useful for telling apart information so you can focus on what is most important to your user. 
I.e. a person may be related to two different legal cases but you want the information segregated.
