Connections in Uwazi link two pieces of information in your collection. It could link a paragraph in one document to a separate document or a word to an entity. 

To name your connections; 
1. Click **Settings**
2. Click on **Relationship Types **

Add the type of connections. Once you have named them, you can begin to create connections.

**Connect properties in two different templates**

Uwazi uses a relationship field in templates. This has some clear advantages like
The allowed targeted entities can be used to ensure only connections to one type of template can be made
* For example: We have a type “country” and we want to add that property to another type- a person. By specifying the select list “Country”, your users will only be able to use country for this field. 
* A relationship type can be defined as well now.

You can configure your relationship fields for existing sets of connections to be displayed as a multiselect field like this:
These connections were added as they were signatories of a document.
