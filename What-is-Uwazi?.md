## What is Uwazi?

For most organisations, managing your documents means putting them into folders and/or categories so you can find them later. (Think: Dropbox, Google Drive, etc)

Uwazi is different. Uwazi goes beyond words and phrases to organise documents. We see each document as a rich information source. Each document tells a story: an email that asks for a favor from a politician, a testimony from a witness of police violence, the ruling of a court on a human rights case. When we can connect these stories, we can see the bigger picture: ongoing corruption, systematic police violence, legal human rights precedence.  

Uwazi is built to do exactly this – create connections between documents in order to better understand and share the collection. For example: you can connect the phrase “Police Killings in Michoacán” in one document to a paragraph in another document that provides more description. You can also connect this phrase to a witness testimony related to the “Police Killings in Michoacán” event. As you curate your document collection by creating these links, your users see a documents connects at a glance and can then dive deeper. 

## Who is it for?

Uwazi is built to address the needs of human rights organisations, but the functionality can be useful to human rights institutions (e.g. national human rights commissions), universities, journalists, courts, and others who work with large document collections. 

## What problem does Uwazi solve?

Most document management systems focus on a document's metadata as its key method of organisation. But for human rights organisations, a document is often more than its metadata - the content itself provides important insight. One paragraph may reference a military commander responsible for a human rights violation, and another paragraph may reference a victim. Each paragraph is important to highlight, tag, organise, reference, and connect to other documents. Uwazi addresses these problems by putting content and connections at the heart of the platform.
