Uwazi supports geolocation of contents. When there are entities in the database whith geolocation properties, the map toggle button will appear in Uwazi's library:

Filters and searches can be used to refine pins on the map. One can toggle between map and card list view.

The map will automatically group pins in clusters. Clicking on a cluster will get us a list of the included geolocated entities:

Clicking on a map ping, or one of the results in the cluster, will display the entity details:
