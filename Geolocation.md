Uwazi supports geolocation of entities and documents. When the database has entities with geolocation properties, the map toggle button will appear as an option in Uwazi's library:

Filters and searches can be used to narrow down pins in the map. Users can toggle between map and card list view.

The map will automatically group pins in clusters. Clicking on a cluster will get us a list of the included geolocated entities:

Clicking on a map ping, or one of the results in the cluster, will display the entity details:

Configuring gelocation involves a simple step. In order to add a geolocation field to an entity or document, drag and drop the field type in the templates configuration:

This will enable a geolocation field. Values can be set via map click or manually introducing the coordinates:
