As an open source tool, we aim to maximize collaboration and personalization of your collections. All the content in Uwazi can be translated into any language. There are two different ways to translate content depending on what you want to have translated:

1. Uwazi Interface: The Uwazi interface contains all translations for every component you see in the application like buttons, alerts, messages, etc. 

To see what languages are available to your collection;
* Click **Settings**
*  Click **Languages**

![](https://github.com/quincywiele/HURIDOCS-User-Manuals/blob/master/languages.png)

* Once all the languages are setup, you will be able to add our own translations or modify the default ones to fit your own criterias 

Note: if you want a language that is not available, please contact our developer team to add it. 
For more information, please review our guide to translating the interface. 

2. Your Content: Every document you upload, entity you create, property or thesauri you add is also translatable.

You may need to translate them yourself sometimes. Please click on “setting” and “translation” to do so.

Check our guide to translate documents and our guide to translate metadata and filters for more information.
