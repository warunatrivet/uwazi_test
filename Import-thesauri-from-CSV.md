# Importing thesauri to Uwazi from CSV files

This feature allows you to import terminology lists in different languages from a CSV file into an Uwazi thesaurus. You can import data into an a new or existing thesaurus.

## Preparing the CSV file

The CSV file should have a separate column for each language you want to import, the language should be used as the name of the column. Each row represents a term and its translations in different languages.

A sample CSV file would look as follows when viewed as plain text:
```csv
English,French,German
Man,Homme,Mann
Woman,Femme,Frau
Child,Enfant,Kind
```
When view in spreadsheet, it would look like:

## HURIDOCS micro-thesauri

HURIDOCS has developed 48 micro-thesauri for the documentation of human rights violations. They are available in several languages as CSV files, see https://www.huridocs.org/resource/micro-thesauri/.


## Notes

- You do not have to include all the languages in your Uwazi instance in the CSV file
- If your CSV file has columns for languages that are not enabled in your Uwazi instance, they will be ignored
- Your CSV file should not have rows with duplicate values in the same column, this will cause a validation error
- The import feature does not support Excel file formats, only CSV files are support. However, you can create a CSV file from your spreadsheet data when saving or downloading the file from your spreadsheet program.
