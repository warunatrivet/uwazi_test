Uwazi supports Vimeo and Youtube video embeddings via custom syntax in rich text fields.

In order to embed a video, add a rich text field to a document or entity and use the following syntax:

* For Vimeo: {vimeo}(https://player.vimeo.com/video/67430069)
* For Youtube: {youtube}(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKtAhJPZS6o)

Video embeddings are displayable and fully functional in library cards, side panel and full width view:
