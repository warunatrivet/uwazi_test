This guide tackles one of the main aspect of translations in Uwazi: **how to translate the Uwazi interface**. You can also check how to [translate metadata, properties, thesaurus...](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Translate-document-metadata-and-filters) or [how to upload translated documents](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Upload-translated-documents).

3. A list of all the phrases used on this context will appear here. The first one is the *base phrase*. This can't be translated to help you remember which was the context in case you decide to modify all the languages. The second and subsequents phrases are related to the different language you have activated in your site. Please [contact the development team](https://www.uwazi.io/contact) if you want to activate another language that is not in your site!

Note: The *base phrase* and the English phrase are usually the same, but you can freely modify the English one in case you found another phrase that suits better with your way of communication.
