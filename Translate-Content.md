## Which content can you translate?

All the content inside Uwazi can be translated to any language you want. There are different ways to translate content (depend on what you want to have translated) but basically they are divided in two main groups:

### Uwazi Interface

The Uwazi Interface (also called "System") contains all translations for every component you see in the application: buttons, alerts, messages... 

As an open source tool, we aim collaboration and personalization on those translations. Inside `Settings > Translation`, you will find all the languages available on your collection. If you want a language that is not already available, [ask our developers team](https://www.uwazi.io/contact/) to add it. Once all the languages are setup, you will be able to add your own translations or modify the default ones to fit your own criteria.

For more information you can review our [guide to translate the interface](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Translate-the-interface).

### Your content

Every document you upload, entity you create, property or thesauri you add is also translatable.

Sometimes you will need to translate them from `Settings > Translation`, other times it will be as easy as changing the language and modify the content there.

Check our [guide to translate documents](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Upload-translated-documents) and our [guide to translate metadata and filters](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Translate-document-metadata-and-filters) for more information.
