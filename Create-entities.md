## Create entities 
An entity in Uwazi is content that is similar to a document in the way it is organised, but does not require a PDF. For example, you may want to create entities in order to include a people, events, courts, or cases in your collection.

Before you create a new entity, you will want to [create your entity template(s)](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Create-entity-types). 

Create a new entity by clicking on the upload icon in the top right corner of the site.
