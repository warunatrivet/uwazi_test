A thesaurus in Uwazi is a list of terms that you will reference in the properties. 

For example, you may want to create a thesaurus for countries so that you can refer to this list when you add the _country_ property to your document template. Using thesauri will make data entry and retrieval more precise, coherent and easy.

You can use the same thesauri across the templates by calling a thesaurus from a property, thus connecting different types of information by a common property.

You can view, edit and delete your existing thesauri by going to _Thesauri_.

## Follow these steps:

## Nested options in thesauri

For big thesauri, grouping values in groups makes information more accessible. In the thesauri creation interface, there is a "Create group" at the bottom action buttons and some controls to move items around:
