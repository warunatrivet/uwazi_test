In Uwazi, a reference is a bookmark that connects selected content in a document to something. This _something_ can be: other selected content in the same document, other selected content in another document, an entire document, or an entity. 

## Reference specific text in a document

1. [Open and view the document or entity](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Open-and-view-a-document)
2. Select the text and click on _Connect to paragraph_
3. Find and select the document that contains the text you want to refer to and itâ€™s relationship type, then click the arrow button. This will open the document you have selected. 
4. Select the text and click **Save**
