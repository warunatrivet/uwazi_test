## Short term
* Finish relationships. Our new relationships features still need much improvement to fully unfold its potential. Based on user feedback and our own ideas, notably:
  * Be able to regroup scattered connections in a hub.
  * Filtering by connection metadata.
  * Connections can also be rendered in the side panel, both in library and in connections view (that would be, the connections of something connected).
  * Improve performance for high volume of relationships.
  * Admins can define a default view (grouping and sorting)

* Library and document search improvement (several issues)
* More accessible documents (show text, etc). Goes along with PDF.js
* PDF pre-render, show text + several usability and SEO improvements, faster opening. Document thumbnail.
* Geo-location
* Graphs
* Support for video and image document types or field types
* Several sorting issues
* Unpublished documents workflow

## Medium term
* Text connections revamp
* Activity log
* Document ownership, different levels of access/sharing (light permissions)
* Better way to deal with default properties (title/date added)
* OCR integration
* Conversion for other formats
* Text references from pages, side panel in pages + several improvements
* Automations: machine learning and other classifiers
* Security audit

## Long term/ideas
* Move document and entity types to "Templates". Have a type of template selector (document, video, entity, image, audio...).
* Matadata from document text workflow + template creation from anywhere
* Federation/syncing
* Advanced search
* Improved permissions
* Hybrid persistence graph/doc
* Comments/annotation - not sure about this one
* Crawl and import existing documents on a website
