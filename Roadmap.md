## Short term
* Finish relationships. Our new relationships features still need much improvement to fully unfold its potential. Based on user feedback and our own ideas, notably:
  * Be able to regroup scattered connections in a hub.
  * Filtering by connection metadata.
  * Connections can also be rendered in the side panel, both in library and in connections view (that would be, the connections of something connected).
  * Improve performance for high volume of relationships.
  * Admins can define a default view (grouping, filtering and sorting)
  * By able to group by entity type and connection type, instead of hubs.
  * Be able to create entities and documents from the relationships tree.
  * Be able to create new relationship types from the relationships tree.
  * Several small tweaks and bug fixes.
  * Admin interface for defining relationship metadata fields.

* Library and document search improvements. Full text search has several issues, with little effort we can offer our users better results and access to the information.
* More accessible documents.
  * Be able to render a text version of the document. Needed for screen readers, search engines and to have proper copy/paste.
  * Detach our text references from a particular PDF.js version. So we can keep that library up to date.
  * Have a pre-render so documents load faster.
  * Have a document thumbnail with the first page.
* Geo-location
* Graphs
* Support for video and image document types or field types
* Several sorting issues
* Unpublished documents workflow

## Medium term
* Text connections revamp
* Activity log
* Document ownership, different levels of access/sharing (light permissions)
* Better way to deal with default properties (title/date added)
* OCR integration
* Conversion for other formats
* Text references from pages, side panel in pages + several improvements
* Automations: machine learning and other classifiers
* Security audit

## Long term/ideas
* Move document and entity types to "Templates". Have a type of template selector (document, video, entity, image, audio...).
* Matadata from document text workflow + template creation from anywhere
* Federation/syncing
* Advanced search
* Improved permissions
* Hybrid persistence graph/doc
* Comments/annotation - not sure about this one
* Crawl and import existing documents on a website
