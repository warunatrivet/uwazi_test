You have the following ways to build the information architecture for your document collection:
* **Create your document templates**
* **Create your entity templates**
* **Manage your dictionaries**
* **Name your connections** 

## How to access your options for structuring the collection

To access your settings, click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the site.

![Gear icon](http://www.uwazi.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gear-icon.png)

You will see the following list of options on the left side, below your settings.

## Create your document or entity templates
Templates allow you to collect structured, consistent metadata on your documents. Within each template, you can assign properties of the type:
* text 
* numeric
* select
* multi-select
* date
* rich text
For example, you may want to create a document template called "NGO Reports" which will contain properties such as title, date published, NGO author, etc. You will create one document template for each type of document that has a distinct set of property types.

An entity, in Uwazi, is content that is similar to a document in the way it is organised, but does not require a PDF. For example, you may want to create entities in order to include a people, events, courts, or cases in your collection. Like document templates, you can create entity templates for each type of entity you are need. 

Under _Documents_, you can view, edit, and delete existing document templates. 

To create a new document template:
1. Click on _Add document_ under _Documents_.
2. You will see two default properties: _Title_, and _Date added_. 
3. Apply property types by dragging them into the designated box. 
4. Click _Save_.

Similarly, under _Entities_, you can view, edit, and delete existing entity templates. 
Create new entity templates by following the instructions for creating a new document template (above). 

When you add a multi-select property to a template, you will see a field titled _Thesauri_ in which you can select a _Dictionary_ or an entity that you have already created. See the section on [managing your dictionaries](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Build-the-information-architecture#manage-your-dictionaries) for more information on how to create these dictionaries. 

## Manage your dictionaries 
A dictionary in Uwazi is a list of terms that you will reference in the properties. For example, you may want to create a dictionary for countries so that you can refer to this list when you add the _country_ property to your document template.

You can view, edit and delete your existing dictionaries by going to _Dictionaries_:

To create a new dictionary: 
1. Click on _Add dictionary_ under _Dictionaries_. 
2. Name your dictionary. 
3. Add items.
4. Click _Save_ when finished.

## Name your connections
A connection is something that links two pieces of information in your collection. It could link a paragraph to a document, or a word to an entity. All you need to do is name these connections here, then create the connections within your collection.
