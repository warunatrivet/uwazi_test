You have the following ways to build the information architecture for your document collection:
* [Create and manage your document and entity templates](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Build-the-information-architecture#create-and-manage-your-document-or-entity-templates)
* [Create and manage your thesauri](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Build-the-information-architecture#create-and-manage-your-thesauri)
* [Name your connections](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Build-the-information-architecture#name-your-connections)

## Create and manage your document or entity templates
Templates allow you to collect structured, consistent metadata on your documents. Within each template, you can assign properties of the type:
* text 
* numeric
* select
* multi-select
* date
* rich text

For example, you may want to create a document template called "NGO Reports" which will contain properties such as title, date published, NGO author, etc. You will create one document template for each type of document that has a distinct set of property types (or the same set of properties but a different name).

An entity, in Uwazi, is content that is similar to a document in the way it is organised, but does not require a PDF. For example, you may want to create entities in order to include a people, events, courts, or cases in your collection. Like document templates, you can create entity templates for each type of entity you are need. 

Under _Document types_, you can view, edit, and delete existing document templates. 

To create a new document template:
1. Click on _Add document type_ under _Document types_.
2. You will see two default properties: _Title_, and _Date added_. 
3. Apply property types by dragging them into the designated box. 
4. Click _Save_.

Similarly, under _Entities_, you can view, edit, and delete existing entity templates. 
Create new entity templates by following the instructions for creating a new document template (above). 

When you add a multi-select property to a template, you will see a field titled _Thesauri_ in which you can select a _Dictionary_ or an entity that you have already created. See the section on [managing your dictionaries](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Create-thesauri) for more information on how to create these dictionaries. 

## Create and manage your thesauri
Check [here the instructions](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Create-thesauri) to create, view and manage your thesauri. 

## Name your connections
A connection is something that links two pieces of information in your collection. It could link a paragraph to a document, or a word to an entity. All you need to do is name these connections here, then create the connections within your collection.
