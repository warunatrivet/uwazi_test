In Uwazi, _editors_ can add translated documents to existing documents in Uwazi. This page explains what needs to be in place in order to add translated documents to Uwazi, and a typical workflow for adding these documents. 

# Requirements
In order to add translated documents to an existing document, you need to have more than one language enabled on your Uwazi instance. To request languages, contact the Uwazi team.

# How the translation system works in Uwazi
* You can translate Uwazi into any language (but we currently do not support right-to-left rendering). 
* When languages are enabled, you will see the language abbreviation in the top right corner of the site. 
* When the user selects a language, they will continue to see all of the available information in Uwazi, but if any of that content is available in the selected language they will see that instead of the default language. * This includes the user interface, document/entity properties, and the documents themselves.
