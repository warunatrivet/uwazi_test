In Uwazi, _editors_ can add translated documents to existing documents in Uwazi. This page explains what needs to be in place in order to add translated documents to Uwazi, and a typical workflow for adding these documents. 

# Requirements
In order to add translated documents to an existing document, you need to have more than one language enabled on your Uwazi instance. To request languages, contact the Uwazi team.

# Uwazi's translation system
* You can translate Uwazi into any language (but we currently do not support right-to-left rendering). 
* When languages are enabled, you will see the language abbreviation in the top right corner of the site. 
* When the _admin_ or _editor_ uploads a document, that document will be attached to the language that is enabled during the upload process. For example, if a document is in English, the user must upload that document when the instance is set to _EN_. 
* When the user selects a language, they will continue to see all of the available information in Uwazi, but if any of that content is available in the selected language they will see that instead of the default language. * This includes the user interface, document/entity properties, and the documents themselves. 

# Workflow: How to add translated documents
1. Switch the website's language to the language of the translated document you are adding. For example, if you are adding a French translation of a document in Uwazi, make sure you have selected _FR_ as the interface language in the top right corner. 
2. Open the document for which you want to add a translated document to. 
3. Go to the attachments tab. 
4. Upload the translated document as an attachment.
