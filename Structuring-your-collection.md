You have the following ways to structure your document collection:
* **Create your document templates**. Within these templates you will assign properties that will allow you to collect structured metadata on your documents. For example, you may want to create a document template called "NGO Reports" which will contain properties such as title, date published, NGO author, etc. You will create one document template for each type of document that has a distinct set of property types. 
* **Create your entity templates**. You may need to organise information in your collection that is not a document. For example, you may want to include a person, event, court, case, etc. You can include each of these as an 'entity' in Uwazi. An entity is organised in the same way that a document is - the only difference is that an entity does not have a PDF attached to it. Like document templates, you can create entity templates for each type of entity you are need. 
* **Define your connections**. A connection is something that links two pieces of information in your collection. It could link a paragraph to a document, or a word to an entity. All you need to do is name these connections here, then create the connections within your collection. 
* **Manage your dictionaries**. A dictionary in Uwazi is a list of terms that you will reference in the properties. For example, you may want to create a dictionary for "countries" so that you can refer to this list when you add the "country" property to your document template.
