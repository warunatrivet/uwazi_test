Uwazi, which means “openness” in Swahili, was developed to make human rights information more accessible and transparent to the defenders who rely on it. It is a web-based platform that goes beyond just storing and tagging documents. Instead, users work directly with the text inside these otherwise uneditable documents to add new layers of information. 

Uwazi makes it easy to record connections between people, documents, and events in a way that speaks best to the logic of the investigating organisation. Combined with the ability to design rigorous and appropriate data models in a user-friendly way, defenders are able to generate reliable conclusions from collected data. This tool supports human rights investigations managing large amounts of source documents and media to advance transitional justice efforts and evidence-based advocacy, all while meeting the pressing security needs of human rights organisations.
