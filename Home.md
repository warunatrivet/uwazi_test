## Ideas

A collection of good ideas people mention in no particular order:

* **Responsive conversion**: when the original styles of the uploaded documents are not relevant (ie, pure text documents), we should offer a conversion to HTML result better adapted to all devices (responsive).
* **Detect duplicated uploads**: when uploading a document that already exists in the system, the user should be notified.
* **Office documents conversion**
* **Contact form**
* (complete) **WYSIWYG pages**: have WYSIWYG pages. User should be able to create a whole page tree adding all the information related to the organization profile, the collection contents, legal disclaimers etc.
* (completed) **Table of contents assistant**
* **Upload multiple documents**
* **Display highlight snippets in full text search results**
* (completed) **Improved filtering (faceted browsing style)**.
* **Advanced search**: take search to the next level where users can even choose how they want filters to stack (AND/OR) and other options TBD.
* (completed) **Display document properties in cards in search results**
* **Relation map view**: Have a graph view displaying relations between documents and other spatially relevant parameters (date, judge, etc).
* **Support OCR**: add OCR capabilities to uploads section.
* **Automatically extract table of contents**
* **Automatically extract document properties**
* **Lazy load of document pages in viewer**: documents may be too big for loading in certain devices. A potential solution for this problem could be implementing a lazy load strategy for document pages.
* **Analytics and user session tracking**
* **Breadcrumb navigation**
* **Import dictionary options from CSV**
* (complete) **Easy way to spot documents that don't have properties existing in the template**: this may typically happen after an edition to the document template.
