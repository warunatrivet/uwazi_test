# An introduction to Uwazi
For most organisations, managing documents means placing them into folders and/or categories so that staff or volunteers can find them later. (Think: Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

What if organising documents could make their contents come alive? Uwazi goes beyond tags and filenames to organise documents. Each document tells a story: an email that asks for a favor from a politician, a testimony from a witness of police violence, the ruling of a court on a human rights case. When these stories are connected, the bigger picture of patterns and systems becomes clearer: ongoing corruption, systematic police violence, legal human rights precedence.

Uwazi is built to do exactly this – highlight and organise the important information in each document, and create relationships between documents. Uwazi illuminates the bigger picture that human rights document collections uncover. 

# Who is it for?
Uwazi was designed to address the unmet needs of human rights organisations. Human rights NGOs, National Human Rights Institutions, universities, journalists, courts, and others who work with large document collections can also benefit from Uwazi’s features like customisable filters and easy-to-use interface.

# What problems does Uwazi solve?
Most document management systems organise contents based on a document’s metadata (such as author, department, person, event, or year). But for human rights organisations, a document is often much more than these basic descriptors assigned to it – the content within the document also provides important insight. Uwazi addresses these problems by putting content and connections at the heart of the platform. Within each document there is important information to highlight, tag, organise, reference, and connect to other documents. In Uwazi, one paragraph referencing a military commander responsible for a human rights violation can be connected to another paragraph in another document that provides more biographical information about the same person.
