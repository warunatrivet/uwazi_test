In your **Settings**, you can create static pages to your Uwazi document collection. You want to add a page that explains what the collection is, or shares your contact information.

## Formatting the content of your page

You can use HTML or [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add images, lists, headers, quotes, and other formatting preferences. For help on using markdown, click on the **Help** tab above the text field for the page.

We have also extended the markdown options to include some [custom syntax for Uwazi users](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Custom-Syntax). This custom syntax allows users to embed lists of document/entity cards based on filter results, and embed YouTube videos.
