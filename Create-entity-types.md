Entity Types allow you to attribute structured, consistent metadata to your entities. Within each Entity type, you can assign properties:
* text 
* numeric
* select
* multi-select
* date, date range, multi date, multi date range
* rich text
* geolocation

For example, you may want to create an entity type called "Court" which will contain properties such as name, judges, location, etc. You will create one entity type for each entity that has a distinct set of properties.

Under _Entities_, you can view, edit, and delete existing entity types. 

## Follow these steps:

1. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the site.

Note: When you add a **multi-select property** to a type, you will see a field titled _Thesauri_ in which you can select a _Dictionary_ or an _Entity type_ that you have already created. See the section on [managing your dictionaries](https://github.com/huridocs/uwazi/wiki/Build-the-information-architecture#manage-your-dictionaries) for more information on how to create these dictionaries.
